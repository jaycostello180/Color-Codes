# Chromatic Collective

A collaborative digital art installation that transforms found color samples into an evolving visual tapestry.

## About the Project

The Chromatic Collective project bridges physical and digital realms through color. Participants find color sample squares throughout the city, scan a QR code, and add the color code to a shared digital artwork that evolves with each contribution.

The project explores how we experience color in our environment and how those experiences can be collectivized into a shared visual language.

## How It Works

1. **Find a Color Square** - Discover a physical color sample with a QR code in the wild
2. **Scan the Code** - The QR directs you to the Chromatic Collective website
3. **Add the Color** - Enter the hex code from the physical sample
4. **Transform the Collective** - Watch as your color is added to the evolving digital artwork

## Viewing Options

The colors can be experienced through multiple lenses:

- **Grid** - All colors in a democratic grid formation
- **Spectrum** - Colors arranged by hue along the color wheel
- **Timeline** - Colors displayed chronologically as they were discovered
- **Map** - Geographical representation of where each color was found
- **Pattern** - Colors arranged in patterns based on their relationships
- **Mosaic** - Varying sizes based on color properties

## Technical Details

This project is built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Designed with a retro-futuristic aesthetic

## Conceptual Framework

Chromatic Collective explores:
- The tension between individual color experiences and collective visual language
- How digital and physical color representations differ and complement each other
- The mapping of color onto urban geography and chronology
- The democratization of artistic contribution

## QR Codes

The QR codes on the physical color samples all point to the same URL, where participants can enter the color code found on the physical sample.

## Future Expansions

- Community data visualization showing patterns in discovered colors
- Time-based variations in the digital representation
- Geographic heat mapping of color preferences
- Physical exhibitions of the digital collection
